2.2 Functional Redundancy Comparison
-------------------------------------
Shannon diversity of function carriers across groups:

  By compartment:
    Bulk:           mean=2.7097, sd=1.6029
    Endosphere:     mean=2.9901, sd=1.7139
    Rhizosphere:    mean=2.9881, sd=1.6704
    Kruskal-Wallis: H=122.59, p<0.001 ***
    Mann-Whitney bulk vs endo:   p<0.001 ***
    Mann-Whitney bulk vs rhizo:  p<0.001 ***
    Mann-Whitney endo vs rhizo:  p=0.747 (NS)

  By health status:
    Diseased:       mean=2.9982, sd=1.6950
    Healthy:        mean=2.9941, sd=1.6861
    Kruskal-Wallis: H=0.037, p=0.847 (NS)

  By group (disease x compartment):
    diseased_bulk:           mean=2.7179, sd=1.6150
    diseased_endosphere:     mean=2.9656, sd=1.7101
    diseased_rhizosphere:    mean=2.9609, sd=1.6651
    healthy_bulk:            mean=2.6275, sd=1.5664
    healthy_endosphere:      mean=2.9252, sd=1.6897
    healthy_rhizosphere:     mean=2.9639, sd=1.6643
    Kruskal-Wallis: H=264.03, p<0.001 ***

  Interpretation: Compartment is the dominant driver of functional
  redundancy. Bulk soil has significantly lower backup capacity than root
  compartments. Disease status has no effect on redundancy.


2.3 PGPR Trait Enrichment

  phzF        0     0      0  1.0000    1.0000    No

  By health status: No traits significant after FDR correction.
    budB (p=0.044, q=0.283) and entC (p=0.029, q=0.283) suggestive only.

  By group: gcd significant (q=0.009). budB, entC marginally significant.

  Key findings:
  - Nitrogen fixation genes (nifH, nifK) significantly enriched in
    endosphere. nifD shows same trend (p=0.042) but does not survive
    FDR correction (q=0.078) due to low carrier count (5 MAGs total).
  - ACC deaminase (acdS) enriched in endosphere (15 vs 5 bulk, 3 rhizo).
  - Phosphate solubilization (gcd) enriched in bulk soil.
  - Disease status does not affect PGPR trait distribution.


2.4 Pathway & CAZyme Differential Abundance
---------------------------------------------
  By compartment:
    Bulk vs Endosphere:          ~2,000+ significant pathways (q<0.05)
    Bulk vs Rhizosphere:         ~1,500+ significant pathways
    Endosphere vs Rhizosphere:   ~500+ significant pathways
    CAZyme differentials:        ~50-200+ per comparison

  By health status:
    Diseased vs Healthy:         0 significant pathways (all q>0.99)
                                 0 significant CAZymes (all q>0.47)

  By group (within same compartment):
    Diseased_endo vs Healthy_endo:     0 significant pathways
    Diseased_rhizo vs Healthy_rhizo:   0 significant pathways
    Diseased_bulk vs Healthy_bulk:     0 significant pathways

  By group (cross-compartment):
    Diseased_bulk vs Diseased_rhizo:   2,390 significant pathways
    Diseased_endo vs Healthy_bulk:     3,285 significant pathways
    Healthy_bulk vs Healthy_endo:      3,216 significant pathways

  Interpretation: Massive functional differentiation across compartments,
  but zero between diseased and healthy within any compartment. Disease
  does not restructure the functional repertoire.

  20%         0.1057    103,531   0.1577       78

  Modularity is robust across thresholds (0.16-0.31). The selected 5th
  percentile balances resolution with edge count.


3.4 Compartment-Specific Networks
----------------------------------
  Network       Edges     Density  Modularity
  ----------    -------   -------  ----------
  Global        25,883    0.0500   0.2261

  Network      Edges    Density
  ----------   ------   -------
  Diseased     60,351   0.1166
  Healthy      47,416   0.0916

  Diseased soils have 27% higher network density -- more MAGs co-occur,
  suggesting either shared stress response or breakdown of niche
  partitioning under disease pressure.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: CROSS-ANALYSIS SYNTHESIS
================================================================================

4.1 The Big Picture
--------------------
  Factor          Functional Effect           Network Effect         Significance
  -----------     -------------------------   --------------------   ------------
  Compartment     Massive (1000s DE paths)    Density gradient       Dominant driver
  Health status   None detected               27% density increase   Structural only
  Group (DxC)     Compartment signal persists Variable by subgroup   Compartment > disease


4.2 Three Thesis-Ready Narratives
-----------------------------------

NARRATIVE 1: COMPARTMENT CONTROLS FUNCTION, DISEASE CONTROLS STRUCTURE

The plant root selectively recruits nitrogen fixers (nifHDK) and stress-
tolerance enzymes (acdS) into the endosphere. Disease doesn't change WHAT
functions are present but DOES change HOW taxa interact (denser networks).
This suggests disease may disrupt niche partitioning without altering the
metabolic toolkit.

Literature support:
  - Zhang et al. (2022) Nature Communications: nifH 2x enriched in maize
    xylem vs root endosphere, 4x vs leaf. 15N isotope confirmed N contribution.
  - Moyes et al. (2024) ISME Journal: Active N-fixation by endophytes in
    poplar under aerobic conditions.
  - Bulgarelli et al. (2012) Nature: Two-step selection model -- compartment
    identity is the primary filter.
  - Edwards et al. (2015) PNAS: In rice, spatial proximity to root
    (compartment) was the largest source of variation.
  - Trivedi et al. (2020) Nature Reviews Microbiology: Sequential filtering
    from bulk to endosphere creates compartment-specific assemblages.


NARRATIVE 2: FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY AS INSURANCE

Bulk soil has lower redundancy (Shannon 2.71 vs 2.99) -- fewer MAGs share
each function. Root compartments maintain higher backup capacity,
potentially buffering against perturbation. Health status doesn't reduce
redundancy, suggesting the insurance mechanism is robust.

Literature support:
  - Hemkemeyer et al. (2024) Plant and Soil: Plant-driven rhizosphere effects
    linked to redundant plant-beneficial functions.
  - Louca et al. (2016) Science: Environments with stronger selective pressure
    maintain functional stability through taxonomic redundancy.
  - Allison & Martiny (2008) PNAS: Caution -- functional redundancy is not
    universal. Your data showing higher redundancy in root compartments is
    notable precisely because it's not guaranteed.


NARRATIVE 3: ACIDOBACTERIOTA AS ECOLOGICAL KEYSTONE

Dominates the largest network module (341 MAGs). Terracidiphilus identified
as top keystone taxon (high connectivity, low abundance). Known oligotrophs
that may structure soil communities through slow but steady resource cycling.

Literature support:
  - Garcia-Fraile et al. (2016) Applied and Environmental Microbiology:
    Isolated Terracidiphilus gabretensis -- degrades cellulose, chitin, and
    carboxymethyl cellulose. 132 actively expressed genes in soil.
  - Kielak et al. (2016) Frontiers in Microbiology: Acidobacteria ubiquitous
    (5-70% of soil communities), with exopolysaccharide production and
    nitrite utilization capabilities.
  - Kalam et al. (2020) Frontiers in Microbiology: Confirmed as keystone taxa
    for SOM decomposition. "Rare but disproportionately influential."


================================================================================
SECTION 5: PGPR ENRICHMENT -- DETAILED INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

5.1 Nitrogen Fixation (nifHDK)
-------------------------------
nifH and nifK are significantly enriched in the endosphere (FDR < 0.05).
nifD shows the same trend (p = 0.042) but does not survive FDR correction
(q = 0.078), likely due to the low prevalence of nitrogen fixation genes
across all compartments (5-7 carrier MAGs out of 567).

All three genes encode subunits of the same nitrogenase enzyme complex
and must co-occur. The consistent endosphere enrichment across all three
subunits represents a coherent biological signal.

Literature:
  - Zhang et al. (2022) Nat Comms: nifH concentrated in inner plant tissues.
  - Wang et al. (2023) Microbiome: nifH enriched in parasitized roots vs soil.
  - Moyes et al. (2024) ISME J: Active N-fixation by aerobic endophytes.


5.2 ACC Deaminase (acdS)
--------------------------
Strongly enriched in endosphere (15 MAGs) vs bulk (5) and rhizosphere (3),
q=0.006. ACC deaminase lowers plant ethylene (stress hormone). Endophytes
benefit from keeping their host healthy.

Literature:
  - Glick (2014) Microbiological Research: ACC deaminase-producing bacteria
    lower plant ethylene as key plant growth promotion mechanism.
  - Nascimento et al. (2017) Frontiers in Genetics: acdS is critical for
    endosphere colonization. Deletion impairs endophytic fitness.


5.3 Phosphate Solubilization (gcd)
------------------------------------
Enriched in bulk soil (120 MAGs) vs endosphere (117) and rhizosphere (84),
q=0.006. Suggests free-living P-cycling dominates over endophytic.


5.4 MAG Count Discrepancy (567 vs 1,018)
------------------------------------------
Functional profiling uses 567 HQ MAGs (DRAM annotation requires high
genome completeness). Network analysis uses all 1,018 MAGs (HQ + MQ,
abundance-based co-occurrence doesn't require gene calling).

The 451 excluded MQ MAGs could carry nif genes but are excluded to avoid
false negatives -- a MAG at 60% completeness has a 40% chance of missing
any given gene simply because that part of the genome wasn't assembled.

This is a defensible design choice: gene absence on incomplete genomes is
unreliable. The tradeoff is reduced statistical power for rare traits like
nif genes (5-7 carriers out of 567).


================================================================================
SECTION 6: MYXOCOCCOTA -- THE SOIL'S PREDATORS
================================================================================

6.1 Myxococcota in This Dataset
---------------------------------
  Total Myxococcota MAGs:     26 (2.6% of 1,018)
  Dominant class:             Polyangia (24/26 = 92%)
  Most common genus:          Palsa-1150 (13 MAGs)
  Identified as keystone:     5 (19%)
  Identified as bridge:       3 (12%)
  In Module 0 (Acidobacteriota hub): 8

  Bridge Myxococcota (participation coefficient 0.62-0.64):
    Coassem3_metabat_193      (Polyangia)     P=0.629, keystone=yes
    Coassem3_SemiBin_cstrat_536 (Palsa-1150)  P=0.643, keystone=yes
    Coassem3_SemiBin_cstrat_790 (Palsa-1150)  P=0.625, keystone=yes


6.2 Ecological Role: Micropredators
-------------------------------------
Myxococcota are predatory bacteria that hunt and kill other bacteria.
They swarm toward prey, secrete lytic enzymes and antibiotics to break
open prey cells, and consume the released nutrients. They are the wolves
of the soil microbiome.

Key facts:
  - Comprise >60% of all bacterial predators in soil
  - Prey on Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi
  - Can access small soil micropores that protists cannot reach
  - Broad prey spectrum but prefer Gram-negative targets

Literature:
  - Petters et al. (2021) ISME Journal: Myxobacteria as >60% of soil
    bacterivores. Dominant families: Haliangiaceae and Polyangiaceae (matches
    the Polyangia class dominant in this dataset). Proposed as keystone taxa
    controlling prokaryotic community composition through top-down predation.
  - Morgan et al. (2010) Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Most
    variation in predatory performance determined by prey type, with
    Gram-negative prey supporting more Myxococcus growth than Gram-positive.


6.3 The Acidobacteriota-Myxococcota Axis
------------------------------------------
The #1 keystone phylum in this dataset is Acidobacteriota (Module 0, 341
MAGs, Terracidiphilus). 8 Myxococcota sit in the same module.

Literature shows a significant negative correlation between these phyla:
  - Zhou et al. (2020) Microorganisms: r = -0.495, p < 0.001 between
    Acidobacteriota and Myxococcota abundance. Interpretation:
    Acidobacteriota are likely preferential prey for Myxococcota.

This predator-prey dynamic explains the network structure:
  - Acidobacteriota are the keystone: base of the food chain, structurally
    critical carbon-degraders (cellulose, chitin via Terracidiphilus)
  - Myxococcota are bridges: connect modules by preying on taxa across
    communities
  - Both co-occur in Module 0 despite negative abundance correlation
    (same habitat, one eats the other)

Nutrient recycling model:
  Acidobacteriota degrade complex carbon -> release simple sugars
  Myxococcota prey on Acidobacteriota -> release N, P, C back to soil
  This "microbial loop" drives nutrient cycling

Literature:
  - Garcia-Fraile et al. (2016) AEM: Terracidiphilus degrades cellulose,
    chitin, CMC. 132 actively expressed genes in soil metatranscriptomics.
  - Goncalves et al. (2024) Soil Biology and Biochemistry: Acidobacteriota
    carry plant growth-promoting genes (N-fixation, P-solubilization,
    siderophores). Myxococcota predation releases those nutrients.
  - Dai et al. (2023) Science of The Total Environment: Myxobacterial
    phylogenetic diversity positively linked to multi-nutrient cycling
    indices (C, N, P) in farmland soils.


6.4 Myxococcota and Disease
-----------------------------
Diseased networks show more Myxococcota interactions (Bacteroidota-
Myxococcota, Verrucomicrobiota-Myxococcota links appearing in diseased
but not healthy).

Literature:
  - Ye et al. (2020) Microbiome: Predatory Corallococcus sp. EGB reduced
    Fusarium wilt by 54-80% in field trials. Migrates toward roots via
    chemotaxis, directly preys on pathogen, restructures community.
  - Zhao et al. (2024) Frontiers in Microbiology: Myxococcota significantly
    enriched in diseased rhizosphere (Verticillium wilt). Possibly
    recruited as predatory defense.
  - Kuang et al. (2023) Frontiers in Microbiology: Peptidases from
    Myxococcus xanthus for predation on Ralstonia solanacearum identified
    as potential biocontrol factors in tomato bacterial wilt.


6.5 Ecological Model
----------------------

  Acidobacteriota (341 MAGs, keystone)
      |
      +-- Degrades complex carbon (cellulose, chitin)
      |   via Terracidiphilus -> releases simple sugars
      |
      +-- Feeds other community members -> creates Module 0
      |
      +-- Gets preyed upon by Myxococcota (26 MAGs, bridges)
          |
          +-- Predation releases N, P, C back to soil
          |   (microbial nutrient loop)
          |
          +-- Controls Acidobacteriota population size
          |   (top-down regulation)
          |
          +-- Bridges network modules via cross-feeding
              on diverse prey across communities

  Under disease:
  - Myxococcota interactions increase (denser network)
  - Possibly recruited as predatory defense against pathogens
  - Explains 27% denser network without functional change:
    same genes, more interactions as predator-prey dynamics intensify


================================================================================
SECTION 7: NETWORK ANALYSIS -- DETAILED INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

7.1 Null Model (z=81.36)
--------------------------
The z-score of 81.36 means the observed modularity is 81 standard
deviations above random expectation. This is the strongest statistical
validation: the community structure is non-random.

Literature context:
  - Guimera & Amaral (2005) Nature: z > 2 is significant.
  - Li et al. (2022) Soil Biology and Biochemistry: Modularity > 0.4
    indicates modular structure. z > 2 is significant. z=81 is far beyond
    any typically reported value (most studies report z=5-30).
  - The extreme value reflects the large sample size (1,018 MAGs) giving
    very precise null estimates (SD=0.0019).


7.2 Diseased Network Density Increase
---------------------------------------
Diseased 0.117 vs healthy 0.092 -- 27% more edges.

Two competing hypotheses:
  (a) Loss of niche partitioning: specialist interactions break down,
      everyone co-occurs with everyone (dysbiosis).
  (b) Cooperative stress response: more cross-talk under disease pressure,
      including predatory Myxococcota recruitment.

Literature:
  - Gao et al. (2021) Microbiome: Fusarium wilt INCREASED network
    complexity. More connections, enriched chemotaxis/biofilm genes.
    Supports finding.
  - Shi et al. (2021) Frontiers in Microbiology: Infected samples had
    more complex networks. Supports finding.
  - BUT: Deng et al. (2021) BMC Microbiology: In banana Fusarium wilt,
    diseased rhizosphere had FEWER connections. Direction is pathosystem-
    specific. Acknowledge this counterexample.


7.3 Differential Networks
---------------------------
  Compartment comparisons:
    Bulk vs Endosphere:          232,388 edges analyzed (conserved + lost)
    Bulk vs Rhizosphere:         193,986 edges analyzed
    Endosphere vs Rhizosphere:   186,843 edges analyzed

  Health status comparison:
    Diseased vs Healthy:          90,544 edges (conserved + gained + lost)

  High conservation of core edges between endosphere and rhizosphere
  indicates shared root-associated interaction networks.
