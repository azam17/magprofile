## 1.1 Oil Palm Industry Significance in Malaysia

Oil palm (*Elaeis guineensis* Jacq.) is the world's most productive oilseed crop, contributing approximately 35% of global vegetable oil production from only 10% of oilseed cropland (Murphy, 2014). Malaysia is the world's second-largest producer after Indonesia, with 5.67 million hectares under cultivation as of 2022 (MPOB, 2023). The oil palm sector is a cornerstone of the Malaysian economy, employing over 650,000 smallholders, contributing approximately 5–7% of national GDP, and generating RM 95 billion in export revenue in 2022 (MPOB, 2023). The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) coordinates research, regulation, and development of the sector.

The crop's exceptional productivity—averaging 3.5–4.0 tonnes of oil per hectare, compared with 0.4–0.6 t/ha for soybean and 0.7 t/ha for rapeseed—underpins food security for billions of consumers globally (Murphy, 2014). However, plantation sustainability faces increasing biological threats, of which basal stem rot is the most devastating.

## 1.2 *Ganoderma boninense* and Basal Stem Rot — The Problem

Basal stem rot (BSR), caused by the white-rot basidiomycete *Ganoderma boninense* Pat., is the most destructive disease of oil palm in Southeast Asia. BSR causes progressive internal decay of the basal stem and root system, leading to nutrient and water uptake failure, crown toppling, and palm death (Chong et al., 2017). Key facts:

- BSR incidence has increased across successive replanting cycles, with some estates reporting >50% infection rates (Idris et al., 2004)
- Estimated annual economic losses exceed RM 1.5 billion in Malaysia
- The pathogen spreads through root-to-root contact and via soil-borne basidiospores
- Symptom expression occurs only at advanced infection stages, making early detection difficult
- No oil palm variety with complete BSR resistance has been identified

Current management strategies include:
- **Cultural practices:** Removal and destruction of infected palms, soil mounding, planting in isolation trenches
- **Chemical control:** Hexaconazole trunk injection (limited efficacy, environmental concerns)
- **Biological control:** *Trichoderma* spp., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Sundram et al., 2019)
- **Early detection:** Molecular markers, hyperspectral imaging

## 1.3 Soil Microbiome as Frontier for BSR Management

The soil microbiome represents an underexplored frontier for BSR management. Disease-suppressive soils—in which pathogen infection is naturally controlled—have been documented for numerous soil-borne diseases including Fusarium wilt, take-all decline, and Rhizoctonia damping-off (Schlatter et al., 2017). The mechanisms underlying disease suppression include:

- Direct antagonism (antibiosis, predation, parasitism)
- Competitive exclusion (nutrient and niche competition)
- Induced systemic resistance (ISR) in the host plant
- Microbiome-mediated chemical signalling

Understanding the composition, function, and interaction networks of the oil palm root-associated microbiome is a prerequisite for developing microbiome-based BSR management strategies.

## 1.4 Why MAGs over Amplicons: Genome-Resolved Advantage

Traditional microbiome studies rely on amplicon sequencing of marker genes (16S rRNA for bacteria/archaea, ITS for fungi), which provides:
- Taxonomic resolution typically to genus level
- No functional information
- Susceptibility to primer bias, chimera formation, and copy number variation
- Inability to link taxonomy with function for individual organisms

Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) overcome these limitations by:
- Recovering near-complete genomes directly from environmental DNA
- Enabling species- or strain-level taxonomic resolution via genome-based taxonomy (GTDB; Parks et al., 2022)
- Providing simultaneous access to functional gene content (KEGG, CAZyme, PGPR traits)
- Enabling co-occurrence network construction at genome resolution
- Meeting MIMAG quality standards for reproducibility (Bowers et al., 2017)

## 1.5 Research Gap

Despite the economic significance of oil palm and the severity of BSR, no study has applied MAG-level analysis to oil palm root-associated microbiomes. Previous work has been limited to:

- 16S rRNA amplicon studies of bulk soil and rhizosphere (Shamsilawani et al., 2020)
- Culturable isolate characterisation
- Single-organism biocontrol trials

Critical gaps remain:
1. No genome-resolved characterisation of the oil palm root microbiome across compartments
2. No assessment of whether BSR disrupts community composition, function, or interaction networks at the MAG level
3. No identification of keystone taxa or specialist guilds in the oil palm microbiome
4. No integration of ecological, functional, and network analyses into a unified resilience framework

## 1.6 Problem Statement

The oil palm root microbiome remains poorly characterised at the genome level, particularly under BSR disease pressure. It is unknown whether compartment-driven assembly—documented in model plants—operates in oil palm, whether disease disrupts this assembly, and whether the microbiome possesses functional and structural resilience mechanisms that could be leveraged for biocontrol.

## 1.7 Research Objectives

This thesis addresses three research objectives:

**Objective 1:** Characterise MAG-level community composition and assembly across root compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, endosphere) and health states (healthy, diseased) in oil palm under BSR.
→ *Addressed in Chapter 3 (Paper 1)*

**Objective 2:** Determine functional capacity and plant growth-promoting potential of compartment-specific microbiomes using genome-resolved annotation.
→ *Addressed in Chapter 4 (Paper 2, functional component)*

**Objective 3:** Elucidate microbial interaction networks and identify keystone taxa associated with community resilience under BSR.
→ *Addressed in Chapter 5 (Paper 2, network component)*

## 1.8 Thesis Organisation and Significance

This thesis is organised into six chapters:

- **Chapter 1** (this chapter): General introduction, research gaps, and objectives
- **Chapter 2:** Literature review covering oil palm BSR, plant microbiomes, metagenomics, community ecology, functional annotation, and network analysis
- **Chapter 3:** Ecological analysis of MAG-level community composition and assembly (Objective 1)
- **Chapter 4:** Functional profiling and PGPR potential of compartment-stratified MAGs (Objective 2)
- **Chapter 5:** Co-occurrence network analysis and keystone taxa identification (Objective 3)
- **Chapter 6:** General discussion, synthesis, and conclusions

**Significance:** This is the first study to apply genome-resolved metagenomics to the oil palm root microbiome under BSR, integrating ecological, functional, and network analyses into a unified insurance hypothesis framework. The findings identify novel microbial guilds (Myxococcota predatory guild, *Roseiarcus* paradox) and keystone taxa (*Terracidiphilus*) as candidates for microbiome-based BSR management, and establish the magprofile software toolkit as an open-source resource for MAG-level community analysis.
